# Ensemble Learning using XGBoost
## Overview  
Using the agaricus dataset, we will examine different results from ensemble learning methods on cross-validation of our classification models.
### Goals 
* Improve Model Performance with Ensemble Learning 
* Use a special boosting algorithm that improves model performance and reduces bias  
### Skills 
* Implement xgboost into model
